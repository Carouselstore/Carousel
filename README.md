# Carousel
Carousel is an Indonesia-based clothing line that puts animal character as its branding, Carousel strives to offer products that are colorful, fun, and stylish. With the tagline "Animals as Your Bestfriends", Carousel hopes that many people will be inspired to care for animals and treat them as their best friends. Carousel raises the five most adopted animal characters as the main icon, namely panda, cat, pig, dino and bear. Thanks to the interesting idea from Carousel Geengs (a term for Carousel followers), five names were chosen, namely: "Choco" (Bear), "Chilo" (Cat), "Popo" (Panda), "Pigko" (Pig), and "Odin" (Dino).
